This is stuff you can borrow from me:

Bouncy ball
Toy car
Little shoes that are too small for me
Clothes that are too small for me.
My favourite character is Captain Booberang
Can you see that picture of BB-8? He's my favourite character. He's the first one in the Star Wars. He's from The Force Awakens.
Kids. Can you see that Batman logo? It's sooo cool.
