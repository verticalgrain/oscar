This is stuff you can borrow from me:

Bouncy ball
Toy car
Little shoes that are too small for me
Clothes that are too small for me.
My favourite character is Captain Booberang
Can you see that picture of BB-8? He's my favourite character. He's the first one in the Star Wars. He's from The Force Awakens.
Kids. Can you see that Batman logo? It's sooo cool.

  <br>Those persons right there are in my family. \/ See those kids down there? Those are my kids. Just kidding. Those are that person who has a black shirt and a white dot in the middle's kids. That person with the black shirt and the white dot in the middle he's about thirty four.
